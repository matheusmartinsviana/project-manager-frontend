Why I use modular CSS? <br>

- **Local Scope**: CSS modules allow you write a style for a specific component without class name conflicts because pf another component with the same class name.

- **Code Maintenance**: You don't have to go through large CSS files to find the styles you want to change. It's easier to maintain and update your code.

- **Better performance**: Styles are only applied where they are needed, you can end up with a smaller, more efficient CSS file.
